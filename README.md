### 📂 What This Repository Contains
This repository showcases a complete Credit Risk Modelling pipeline, including:
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA
- PD (Probability of Default) modelling using Logistic Regression
- IFRS-9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL) framework implementation
- Documentation (BRD, FSD, User Stories)
- Agile workflow tracked through Jira

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary

The Exploratory Data Analysis phase focused on understanding borrower behavior, identifying risk patterns, validating data quality, and uncovering predictive relationships relevant to credit default (SeriousDlqin2yrs).

### 🔍 Key Insights

#### 1. Applicant Demographics
- **Age distribution is right-skewed**, with most borrowers between **30–60 years**.
- Very few borrowers are below 25 or above 75, reducing noise for age-based risk segmentation.

#### 2. Revolving Utilization (Credit Card Usage)
- Highly skewed with extreme outliers (values > 1.0).
- **Defaulters tend to show higher utilization**, indicating risk from maxed-out credit lines.

#### 3. Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
- Extremely wide range with large outliers.
- Defaulters consistently exhibit **higher median DebtRatio**.

#### 4. Monthly Income
- Distribution is right-skewed with income outliers above ₹20 lakh (dataset equivalent).
- Default rates do **not decrease proportionally** with higher income — suggesting income alone is not a strong predictor.

### 🧱 Delinquency Pattern Analysis (Most Important EDA Insight)

We analyzed three delinquency buckets:

| Bucket | Meaning | Behavior |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **DPD 30–59** | Mild delinquency | Early warning indicator |
| **DPD 60–89** | Medium delinquency | Strong signal of financial stress |
| **DPD 90+** | Default proxy | Strongest predictor of SeriousDlqin2yrs |

#### 🔥 Findings
- All three delinquency variables are **skewed with most customers having 0 delinquency**.
- Strong positive correlations:
  - **DPD 60–89 ↔ DPD 90+** (0.66)
  - **DPD 30–59 ↔ DPD 60–89** (0.56)
- Customers with repeated 30–59 day delinquencies often progress to 60–89 and then 90+ status.

#### IFRS-9 Interpretation
- **Performing Loans (Stage 1):** No delinquencies → 12-month ECL  
- **SICR (Stage 2):** Repeated 30–59 or 60–89 delinquencies → Lifetime ECL  
- **Default (Stage 3):** 90+ DPD → Lifetime ECL + interest reversal  

These delinquency patterns directly support IFRS-9 staging logic in later modeling steps.

### 🗂️ Outlier & Correlation Analysis
- Outliers present in **Revolving Utilization**, **DebtRatio**, and **MonthlyIncome**.
- Correlation heatmap confirms:
  - Delinquency buckets are strong predictors of default.
  - Other features show weak to moderate correlations.

### ✅ EDA Outcome
The dataset is:
- Cleaned  
- Validated  
- Understood statistically  
- Ready for **Feature Engineering** and **PD Model Development**
