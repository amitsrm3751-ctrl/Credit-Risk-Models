# Credit Risk Models — User Stories

## 1. Data Collection (Kaggle Dataset)
**As a** Data Analyst  
**I want to** collect and download relevant credit risk datasets from Kaggle  
**So that I can** build a clean, well-structured dataset for model development and analysis.

## 2. Customer Data Preparation
**As a** Credit Risk Analyst  
**I want to** clean and preprocess customer data  
**So that I can** ensure the modelling dataset is analysable and error-free.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**As a** Credit Risk Analyst  
**I want to** perform EDA on customer financial data  
**So that I can** understand patterns, distributions, and risk indicators.

## 4. Feature Engineering
**As a** Data Scientist

**So that I can** improve the predictive power of the model.

## 5. PD Model Development
**As a** Credit Risk Modeller  
**I want to** build a Probability of Default model  
**So that I can** classify customers into good/bad risk categories.

## 6. Model Validation
**As a** Risk Reviewer  
**I want to** evaluate AUC, KS, and Confusion Matrix  
**So that I can** ensure the model is accurate and reliable.

## 7. IFRS-9 ECL Calculation
**As a** Credit Portfolio Manager  
**I want to** compute ECL using PD × LGD × EAD  
**So that I can** estimate expected losses and comply with IFRS-9.

## 8. Reporting & Dashboard
**As a** Business Stakeholder  
**I want to** view the model outputs in a dashboard  
**So that I can** make informed and faster decisions.
